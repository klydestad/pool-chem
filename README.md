# Pool Chemistry Diagnostic Tool
## Project Overview
A Python-based analysis tool that helps pool operators manage chemical levels by:
* Analyzing whether chemical levels are within acceptable ranges
* Calculating required chemical adjustments
* Providing clear recommendations for corrections
* Tracking historical data

## Motivation
Manual calculations of pool chemistry adjustments are time-consuming and error-prone. This tool automates these calculations while providing more accurate results.

## Features
* Automated range validation
* Chemical adjustment calculations
* Historical data tracking
* Recommendation generation
* Data visualization
* Export functionality

## Technical Details
* Language: Python
* Environment: Jupyter Notebooks
* Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib
* Key concepts: Data analysis, mathematical modeling, user input validation
