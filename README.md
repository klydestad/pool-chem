# Pool Chemistry Diagnostic Tool

OBJECTIVE:

The purpose of this project is to act as a diagnostic tool for lifeguards during pool tests.



INTRODUCTION:

At a public pool, lifeguards are responsible for maintaining balanced pool chemistry levels, including combined chlorine, total chlorine, free chlorine, alkalinity, pH, and more. When these are out of balance, potential consequences include skin and eye irritation, unpleasantly smelling or coloured water, chemical burns, and spread of diseases. Therefore, it is crucial that chemical levels are adjusted as needed.



CURRENT USES:

- Given the ideal range, ideal number, and observed levels of a chemical, the program can:
1. Indicate whether a level is out of range or not
2. Indicate the difference between the ideal measurement and the observed one
3. Based on the results from 2., indicate how much of the correct chemical to add



USES IN PROGRESS:

4. Implement uses 1-3 for all chemicals, separately
5. Implement uses 1-3 for all chemicals, together
6. Helpful tips on proper protective equipment to use
7. Given a full range of pool data, provide functions 1-3 in order of addition
8. Same as 7. but with consideration to other chemicals being added
 


FUTURE APPLICATIONS:

- As the program imports data in a .csv format, if pool test results were moved onto excel sheets instead of on paper, another function could be added:
9. Display a trend of measurements, and calculate the rate of increase/decrease using a model (this could help detect problems with the pool)
